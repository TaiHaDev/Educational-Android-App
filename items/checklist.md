# Group Assignment Checklist
The following markdown document is a checklist of items you **should** complete before submission of your assignment. This exists to help you keep track of all the requirements you must fulfil.

## Git & Project Access
- [ ] **GitLab**: Commits (as shown in the Git commit history) using your own account. Failing to do this may result in zero marks.
- [ ] **GitLab**: Have the relevant marking tutors as 'maintainers' for your repository.
- [ ] The markers will be able to login to your **App** via the APK using either of the 2 sets of accounts in the assignment specification.
- [ ] If **Firebase** has been used, you have added the Marker's email to your Firebase project, and included the link to your Firebase project in your report.

## Documents (all non-android files) located in a folder named `items`
- [ ] A conflict resolution protocol is documented and well-defined.
- [ ] All Team Meeting Minutes (at least 4, with links in the report). 
- [ ] Create a video titled  `features.(mp4|mov|wmv)` that demonstrates each implemented feature (basic + general), in the same order as listed in the report.
- [ ] A working standalone **APK**, i.e., an APK that can be loaded and execute correctly on an AVD.
- [ ] Have a markdown report document titled 'report.md'.
- [ ] **Statement of Originality**: All members have read and signed the [statement of originality](./statement-of-originality.yml). Failure to do so will result in zero marks.
- [ ] All external code, assets or help received outside the group is documented in the [statement of originality](./statement-of-originality.yml) and relevant parts in the code.
- [ ] **Pledge of Academic Integrity**: All members have read and signed the [Pledge of Academic Integrity](./integrity.md).

in the templates for both report and meeting minutes before submitting.
